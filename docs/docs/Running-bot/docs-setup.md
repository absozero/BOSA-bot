# Setup documentation

This project uses mkdocs as its documentation generator, and uses the theme mkdocs-material 
over it.

## Instructions

First, set up a virtual environment by using
```python
python -m venv venv
then either 
venv/Scripts/activate.bat/ps1
or
. venv/bin/activate
```
Then run 
```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Finally, in the venv, run 
```
mkdocs help for command info
```
