- Then, ***run the bot.py*** file using 
```py
python bot.py
```
-  In whatever terminal you use, make sure the ***terminal is at the directory*** in which the file is in.

## Another simple way to use
- Add the bot to your server(bot requires admin permissions):
- [Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=844755365191352358&permissions=8&scope=bot)
- The bot will not be running all the time since I run it locally so the better option would definitely be to host it yourself.

## Conclusion 

- Have fun while using it! (Being actively developed by 1 person, so development may be slow.)
