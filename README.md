## Info
A discord spam bot that will become a general discord bot.
- It is being actively developed.
- May be slightly unstable


**Version 2.0**


## Setup and Usage
-Download source code from 'releases' tab on github or clone using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/absozero/BOSA-bot.git
```
- Requires **python downloaded** and the discord.py module
  - <https://www.python.org/downloads>
- First,create an application on the discord developer portal 
  - [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - After creating a bot in the bot tab, copy the token by press

- Then, ***run the bot.py*** file using 
```py
python bot.py
```
-  in whatever terminal you use, make sure the ***terminal is at the directory*** in which the file is in.

## Another simple way to use
- Add the bot to your server(bot requires admin permissions):
- [Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=844755365191352358&permissions=8&scope=bot)
- The bot will not be running all the time since I run it locally so the better option would definitely be to host it yourself.

## Conclusion 

- Have fun while using it! (Being actively developed by 1 person, so development may be slow.)
