## Info
A discord spam bot that will become a general discord bot.
- It is being actively developed.
- May be slightly unstable


**Version 2.0**

  [python(download with pip)](https://www.python.org/downloads)

  -[Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

- Then, run the bot.py file using 
```py
python bot.py
```

##Another simple way to use
- Add the bot to your server(bot requires admin permissions): https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=844755365191352358&permissions=8&scope=bot
- The bot will not be running all the time since I run it locally so the better option would definitely be to host it yourself.

## Conclusion 

- Have fun while using it! (Being actively developed by 1 person, so development may be slow.)
