This is a project, called bosa-bot that was built on discord.py but now, runs on the py-cord library, a fork of the original discord.py lib.

  

## Installation

 
 The bot is easy to set up, but the steps have been explained to an extent that they cannot really fit into this README well. So, they have been put on the [website.](https://absozero.github.io/bosa-bot)

## Development setup

  To setup for development, please clone and run the bot as you normally would, and run the code given, but make changes to the code to customize and improve the bot for yourself.

## Changelog/Roadmap

 - [ ] Add new modules and cogs
 - [ ] Make sure backend libs are trustable
 - [ ] Improve uptime.
